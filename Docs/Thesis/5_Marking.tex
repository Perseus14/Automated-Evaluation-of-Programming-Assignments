    This module is primarily for Incorrect solutions. The idea is to categorize the solution into the nearest cluster by calculating similarity measure with each of the Gold Standard solutions (Correct Solutions) and clustering into the nearest group.
    
    We get the similarity measure from the above module and find the most similar gold standard program and assign the cluster which the gold standard program is in.
    
    To assign a grade we use many factors like the no. of testcases it passed, the running time, amount of memory used, strength of similarity and intra-cluster distance, etc...
