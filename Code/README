Run python run.py with a Contest IDï»¿
then run make similarity followed by make cluster then make marking

eg:

python get_cfiles.py <ID>      # Creates a c_file_list for both correct and incorrect programs
make similarity		  # Creates a similarity measure file
make cluster		  # Creates clusters of programs	
make marking		  # - Creates similarity measure of incorrect vs all correct soln. 
						- Cluster to nearest program with highest 							similarity measure. 
					    - Grades the solution based on formula #TODO
